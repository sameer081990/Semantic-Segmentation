# U-Net Semantic Segmentation

This repository contains an implementation of semantic segmentation using the U-Net architecture. The project is designed for segmenting images into multiple classes and includes robust preprocessing, data augmentation, and model monitoring tools.

## Features

- **Model Architecture**: U-Net, a popular convolutional neural network for image segmentation tasks.
- **Data Augmentation**: Utilized **Albumentations** library for advanced augmentation techniques to improve generalization.
- **Automated Dataset Preparation**: Streamlined processes for dataset preparation, including labeling validation and directory structuring.
- **Monitoring**: Integrated **TensorBoard** for real-time visualization of training metrics and performance evaluation.
- **Custom Dataset Handling**: Leveraged **PyTorch** for efficient custom dataset creation and DataLoader management.
- **Visualization**: Used **Matplotlib** for detailed visualization of predictions and metrics.

## Dependencies

To run the project, ensure you have the following libraries installed:

- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- Albumentations
- Matplotlib
- TensorBoard
- NumPy
- OpenCV (for image processing)
- scikit-learn (optional for metrics)
- tqdm (for progress bars)

You can install all dependencies using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Getting Started

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/U-Net-Semantic-Segmentation.git
cd U-Net-Semantic-Segmentation
```

### Dataset

Ensure your dataset is structured as follows:

```
dataset/
├── images/
│   ├── image1.jpg
│   ├── image2.jpg
│   └── ...
├── masks/
│   ├── mask1.png
│   ├── mask2.png
│   └── ...
```

Replace `image1.jpg` and `mask1.png` with your own data.

### Run the Notebook

Launch the notebook using Jupyter or a similar environment:

```bash
jupyter notebook Unet_Semantic_segmentation.ipynb
```

Follow the step-by-step instructions in the notebook to train the U-Net model and visualize results.

## Results

- **Segmentation Accuracy**: Achieved X% accuracy on the validation dataset (replace with your results).
- **Predictions**: Visualized predictions and overlays for evaluation.

## Project Highlights

- Hands-on implementation of the U-Net model for semantic segmentation.
- Efficient preprocessing pipeline for image segmentation tasks.
- Real-time monitoring of training progress using TensorBoard.
